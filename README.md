# PHP-Salesforce-Project-Actual
This is the actual project I made as test for an interview.

My task was to implement an interface and then create a class in PHP that would connect to salesforce utilizing the REST API, retrieve data, edit data, and upload data


I am using the five page with Oauth 2.0 setup instead of this one. I did not realize that this get access does not work unless the other program that sends to login and allows access has ran first. I may just need to tweek this one, but do not have time to figure it out currently. Feel free to fork and use it if you like.
